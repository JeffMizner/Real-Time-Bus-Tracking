# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
## Bus Tracking Exercise
This is an exercise showing the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS as real-time bus tracking for the Route 7 bus in downtown Boston. This is compiled and displayed using MapboxGL and the MBTA API. 

## How to Use
Copy the .html, .css, and .js files to your system. Open the index.html file within your browser and track the Route 7 bus on its journey through Boston.

## Future Improvements
I plan on researching and adding map zoom functionality as well as the addition of other routes, differentiated by color. I would also like to change the marker style from a teardrop to an actual bus icon.
