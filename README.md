# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
Real time bus tracking for the Route 7 bus in downtown Boston. This is compiled and displayed using MapboxGL and the MBTA API. 

# Future updates
I plan on researching and adding map zoom functionality as well as the addition of other routes, differentiated by color. I would also like to change the marker style from a teardrop to an actual bus icon.
